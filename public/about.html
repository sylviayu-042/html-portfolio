<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Sylvia by name, born and bred in Nigeria and still in Nigeria. 
  I got into this course "Web development" because websites have been something that always amazed me, I always wanted to find out what it was all about, how it came and basically how it works.
  I also need a software development career to make decent living even though I'm still a student, it's still interesting to have something doing that earns you money.
</p>

<p>I'm very good at what I do too, i believe that whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well.
  I'd rather try out new stuffs and fail with lessons learnt than not trying at all.
  This course has been quite challenging and eye opening too, with some challenges that almost make you question your mental capacity,lol!
  But then again, it wouldnt be fun without the trials and failures would it?
</p>

<p>I really really look forward to working with you all in this web development industry, I know that it's going to be really nice to meet some pros and clients too!!
  I'll also like to try out other courses on software development, it wouldn't do any harm to broaden the knowledge and also have diverse skills and consequently sources of income.
  Thank Y'all, mwahhh!!!!
